<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Kelly Burke.</p>

<p>I worked for 10 years as a Supervisor in the Technical Services department of a construction company. I realized <br>
  early on in my career that there wasn't much room for growth so I went back to college. I earned my Bachelor's Degree in <br>
  May of 2022 in four concentrations - Management Information Systems, Accounting, Finance, and Marketing. I was <br>honored 
  as the top graduate of my class and gave a speech at the graduation ceremony. I pursued my MBA after graduation.<br> My 
  concentrations are in Data Analytics, Program and Project Management, and Accounting.</p>

<p>While attempting to transfer into the technology field, I soon realized how important networking and certifications<br> 
  were going to be for my new career. I pursued certifications: Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate;<br> SAP Technology 
  Consultant Professional Certificate; and this Full-Stack Web Developer Certification. This website<br> serves as a portfolio of 
  my work. Enjoy and contact me if you would like me to work with you on a project.</p>
